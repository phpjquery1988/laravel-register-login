Routing
Web Routes

Default route setup is used, which includes authentication routes:
Auth::routes();
Route::get('/home', [App\Http\Controllers\HomeController::class, 'index'])->name('home');
PHP
API Routes
For this simple application, no separate API routes were created. All interactions are handled through the web routes.
Form Validation and Error Handling
Backend Validation: Handled by Laravel's default validation system.
Frontend Validation: Error messages are displayed using Vue.js.
Error Handling: Errors are captured using axios and displayed under the respective input fields in the form.
Configuration Decisions
Laravel
Built-in Authentication: Utilized Laravel's built-in authentication scaffolding (php artisan ui vue --auth), which provides pre-built login and registration forms and routes.
Middleware: Default middleware setup is used to ensure proper request handling and session management.
Vue.js
Component-Based Architecture: Created separate components for login and registration to maintain separation of concerns.
Axios for HTTP Requests: Used axios for making HTTP requests to Laravel backend and handling responses.
